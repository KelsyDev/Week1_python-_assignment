Simple Calculator
This is a simple Python program that performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user.

Description
The program prompts the user to input two numbers. It then converts these inputs into floating-point numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them. The results of each operation are printed to the console.

Usage
Run the program.

Input the first number when prompted.

Input the second number when prompted.

The program displays the results of the four arithmetic operations between the two numbers.

Features
Handles decimal numbers by converting inputs to float.

Prints clear results for each operation.

Note: Division operation assumes the second number is not zero (dividing by zero will raise an error).

Example
text
Type the first number: 10
Type the second number: 2
Here are the results:
Addition:  10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0
Subtraction:  10.0 - 2.0 = 8.0
Multiplication:  10.0 * 2.0 = 20.0
Division:  10.0 / 2.0 = 5.0
Limitations
The program does not currently handle invalid (non-numeric) inputs.

Division by zero is not handled and will raise an error.
